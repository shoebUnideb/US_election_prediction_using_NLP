# US Election Prediction using NLP

## Overview

This project employs **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze public sentiment and predict US election outcomes. By leveraging text data from various sources, we preprocess and analyze sentiment trends to gain insights into political preferences. The workflow involves data cleaning, sentiment analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Used for data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Plotly**: Employed for visualization of sentiment trends.
- **NLTK & TextBlob**: Essential libraries for text preprocessing and sentiment analysis.
- **WordCloud**: Generates visual representations of frequently used words in election-related discussions.
- **Regular Expressions (re)**: Cleans raw text data by removing unnecessary symbols and noise.
- **Machine Learning (if applicable)**: If included, various models such as Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes are used for prediction.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Removal of stop words, punctuation, and tokenization.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizes polarity and subjectivity scores to determine public opinion.
- **Word Cloud Generation**: Visualizes the most common words in political discussions.
- **Statistical Insights**: Quantifies sentiment polarity distribution.
- **Predictive Modeling (if applicable)**: Implements machine learning techniques to predict election outcomes.

## Installation

To set up the environment, install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
pip install nltk wordcloud textblob pandas numpy matplotlib plotly
```

Additionally, ensure NLTK stopwords and wordnet resources are downloaded:

```sh
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('punkt')
```

## Usage

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook** to preprocess data and analyze sentiment.
2. **Visualize trends** using generated plots and word clouds.
3. **Train a predictive model** (if applicable) to classify sentiment and forecast election outcomes.

## Results

- **Sentiment Distribution**: Visualization of public opinion polarity.
- **Word Cloud Representation**: Highlights commonly discussed topics.
- **Election Forecast**: Predictive analysis based on sentiment trends.
